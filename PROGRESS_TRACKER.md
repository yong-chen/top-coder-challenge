# Top Coder Challenge Progress Tracker

**Challenge Started:** 2025-06-07T15:09:45-05:00  
**Target Completion:** 8 hours  
**Challenge End:** 2025-06-07T23:09:45-05:00  

## Project Summary

**Goal:** Reverse-engineer a 60-year-old legacy travel reimbursement system by analyzing:
- 1,000 historical input/output examples (`public_cases.json`)
- Employee interviews with system hints (`INTERVIEWS.md`)
- Business requirements (`PRD.md`)

**Deliverables:**  
- `run.sh` script that takes 3 parameters and outputs reimbursement amount
- Must match legacy system behavior exactly (including bugs/quirks)
- Evaluation against 1,000 test cases

### Phase 3: Pattern Discovery & Refinement  
- [x] **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Expense cap system

  - [x] Trip duration sweet spots - Confirmed in ML features
  - [x] Complex interaction effects - Validated (Lisa's theory)
- [x] Git commits: Algorithm evolution

### Phase 4: Edge Case Handling
- [ ] Handle boundary conditions
- [ ] Implement suspected "bugs" or quirks
- [ ] Fine-tune for maximum accuracy
- [ ] Git commits: Edge case fixes

### Phase 5: Final Testing & Submission
- [ ] Final eval.ps1 run
- [ ] Generate private results
- [ ] Repository cleanup
- [ ] Final git tag: SUBMISSION
- [ ] Add arjun-krishna1 to repo
- [ ] Submit form

## Key Insights from Analysis

### From Employee Interviews:
1. **Marcus (Sales):** 
   - System behavior varies by time of month/quarter
   - Sweet spot around 5-6 day trips
   - Mileage calculation may have distance thresholds
   - Receipt spending has caps/penalties
   - Possible "efficiency bonus" for high mileage/short time

2. **Lisa (Accounting):**
   - Complex system with layered rules
   - Rounding behaviors
   - Monthly/quarterly variations

3. **Dave (Marketing):**
   - Route optimization affects reimbursement
   - Timing theories (lunar cycles!)

4. **Jennifer (Operations):**
   - Strategic planning improves outcomes
   - Department-specific variations possible

5. **Kevin (Procurement):**
   - Statistical correlations with submission timing
   - Data-driven approach to optimization

### Key Algorithm Components to Investigate:
- [x] Base per-diem calculation (days * rate)
- [x] Mileage reimbursement (with potential thresholds)
- [x] Receipt reimbursement (with caps/penalties)
- [x] Efficiency/complexity bonuses
- [x] Time-based multipliers
- [x] Interaction effects between components

### **Windows Compatibility Solution:**
- **Issue:** Original challenge uses bash scripts (`run.sh`, `eval.sh`) which don't work natively on Windows
- **Solution:** Created Windows-native alternatives:
  - `run.ps1` - PowerShell implementation wrapper
  - `run.bat` - Batch file fallback for compatibility  
  - `eval.ps1` - Full PowerShell evaluation script with progress tracking
- **Core Implementation:** Python script for maximum portability and data science capabilities

## Key Algorithm Components Discovered:

### **Validated Employee Theories:**
- **Lisa's "Complex Interactions"**: R² improved 0.78→0.91 with interaction terms
- **Dave's "Route Complexity"**: days_miles interaction is top-2 feature (25% importance)  
- **Marcus's "Efficiency Bonus"**: Not statistically significant

### **ML Model Insights (R²=0.91):**
1. **receipts_squared (27%)** - Quadratic relationship with receipt amount
2. **days_miles (25%)** - Trip complexity interaction  
3. **receipts (25%)** - Base receipt importance
4. **days_receipts (15%)** - Duration-expense interaction

### **EXPENSE CAP DISCOVERY:**
- **>$2000 receipts**: Severe cap (~$300-700 total reimbursement)
- **>$1500 receipts**: ~75% reduction from ML prediction
- **>$1000 receipts**: ~90% of ML prediction
- **Explains largest errors**: Cases with high expenses get capped
