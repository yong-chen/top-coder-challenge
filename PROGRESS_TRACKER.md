## Project Summary

**Goal:** Reverse-engineer a 60-year-old legacy travel reimbursement system by analyzing:
- 1,000 historical input/output examples (`public_cases.json`)
- Employee interviews with system hints (`INTERVIEWS.md`)

**Deliverables:**  
- `run.sh` script that takes 3 parameters and outputs reimbursement amount
- Must match legacy system behavior exactly (including bugs/quirks)

## Key Insights from Analysis

### From Employee Interviews:
1. **Marcus (Sales):** 
   - System behavior varies by time of month/quarter
   - Sweet spot around 5-6 day trips
   - Mileage calculation may have distance thresholds
   - Receipt spending has caps/penalties
   - Possible "efficiency bonus" for high mileage/short time

2. **Lisa (Accounting):**
   - Complex system with layered rules
   - Rounding behaviors
   - Monthly/quarterly variations

3. **Dave (Marketing):**
   - Route optimization affects reimbursement
   - Timing theories (lunar cycles!)

4. **Jennifer (Operations):**
   - Strategic planning improves outcomes
   - Department-specific variations possible

5. **Kevin (Procurement):**
   - Statistical correlations with submission timing
   - Data-driven approach to optimization

### Key Algorithm Components to Investigate:
- [x] Base per-diem calculation (days * rate)
- [x] Mileage reimbursement (with potential thresholds)
- [x] Receipt reimbursement (with caps/penalties)
- [x] Efficiency/complexity bonuses
- [x] Time-based multipliers
- [x] Interaction effects between components

### **Windows Compatibility Solution:**
- **Issue:** Original challenge uses bash scripts (`run.sh`, `eval.sh`) which don't work natively on Windows
- **Solution:** Created Windows-native alternatives:
  - `run.ps1` - PowerShell implementation wrapper
  - `run.bat` - Batch file fallback for compatibility  
  - `eval.ps1` - Full PowerShell evaluation script with progress tracking
- **Core Implementation:** Python script for maximum portability and data science capabilities
