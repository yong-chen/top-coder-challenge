# Top Coder Challenge Progress Tracker

**Challenge Started:** 2025-06-07T15:09:45-05:00  
**Target Completion:** 8 hours  
**Challenge End:** 2025-06-07T23:09:45-05:00  

## Project Summary

**Goal:** Reverse-engineer a 60-year-old legacy travel reimbursement system by analyzing:
- 1,000 historical input/output examples (`public_cases.json`)
- Employee interviews with system hints (`INTERVIEWS.md`)
- Business requirements (`PRD.md`)

**Deliverables:**  
- `run.sh` script that takes 3 parameters and outputs reimbursement amount
- Must match legacy system behavior exactly (including bugs/quirks)
- Evaluation against 1,000 test cases

## Analysis Checklist

### Phase 1: Understanding & Analysis
- [x] Read README.md - requirements understood
- [x] Read PRD.md - business context understood  
- [x] Scan INTERVIEWS.md - employee insights gathered
- [x] Examine repository structure
- [x] Review template files
- [x] **Windows Compatibility Setup** - Created PowerShell/Batch alternatives
  - [x] Created run.ps1 (PowerShell implementation)
  - [x] Created run.bat (Batch fallback)
  - [x] Created eval.ps1 (Windows-native evaluation)
- [ ] Deep analysis of public_cases.json data patterns
- [ ] Identify potential algorithm components from interviews
- [ ] Statistical analysis of input/output correlations

### Phase 2: Initial Implementation
- [ ] Copy run.sh.template to run.sh
- [ ] Choose implementation language (Python/Node.js/Bash)
- [ ] Create basic calculation framework
- [ ] Initial test with eval.sh
- [ ] Git commit: Initial implementation

### Phase 3: Pattern Discovery & Refinement
- [ ] Analyze exact vs close matches from initial test
- [ ] Implement iterative improvements based on patterns
- [ ] Test key theories from interviews:
  - [ ] Mileage calculation patterns
  - [ ] Receipt amount thresholds/caps
  - [ ] Trip duration sweet spots
  - [ ] Complex interaction effects
- [ ] Git commits: Pattern discoveries

### Phase 4: Edge Case Handling
- [ ] Handle boundary conditions
- [ ] Implement suspected "bugs" or quirks
- [ ] Fine-tune for maximum accuracy
- [ ] Git commits: Edge case fixes

### Phase 5: Final Testing & Submission
- [ ] Final eval.sh run
- [ ] Generate private results
- [ ] Repository cleanup
- [ ] Final git tag: SUBMISSION
- [ ] Add arjun-krishna1 to repo
- [ ] Submit form

## Key Insights from Analysis

### From Employee Interviews:
1. **Marcus (Sales):** 
   - System behavior varies by time of month/quarter
   - Sweet spot around 5-6 day trips
   - Mileage calculation may have distance thresholds
   - Receipt spending has caps/penalties
   - Possible "efficiency bonus" for high mileage/short time

2. **Lisa (Accounting):**
   - Complex system with layered rules
   - Rounding behaviors
   - Monthly/quarterly variations

3. **Dave (Marketing):**
   - Route optimization affects reimbursement
   - Timing theories (lunar cycles!)

4. **Jennifer (Operations):**
   - Strategic planning improves outcomes
   - Department-specific variations possible

5. **Kevin (Procurement):**
   - Statistical correlations with submission timing
   - Data-driven approach to optimization

### Key Algorithm Components to Investigate:
- [ ] Base per-diem calculation (days * rate)
- [ ] Mileage reimbursement (with potential thresholds)
- [ ] Receipt reimbursement (with caps/penalties)
- [ ] Efficiency/complexity bonuses
- [ ] Time-based multipliers
- [ ] Interaction effects between components

### **Windows Compatibility Solution:**
- **Issue:** Original challenge uses bash scripts (`run.sh`, `eval.sh`) which don't work natively on Windows
- **Solution:** Created Windows-native alternatives:
  - `run.ps1` - PowerShell implementation wrapper
  - `run.bat` - Batch file fallback for compatibility  
  - `eval.ps1` - Full PowerShell evaluation script with progress tracking
- **Core Implementation:** Python script for maximum portability and data science capabilities
